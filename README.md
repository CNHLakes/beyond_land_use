## Potential predictor variables

  - LAGOS
      - Lake depth
      - IWS area
      - IWS/Lake area
  - Cropland Data Layer
      - IWS pasture types (forage or not)
      - IWS specific crops (corn, wheat, etc.)
      - IWS crop frequency/rotation
  - gSSURGO
      - IWS wetland potential (as a proxy for tile drainage)
      - IWS soil organic carbon
      - IWS root zone depth
      - IWS lithology (sand %, clay %, etc.)
  - USGS
      - IWS from county - manure, fertilizer, and deposition of N,P

## Research questions

## Timeline

## Issues

  - Availability of data products through time is highly variable. How
    to align or decide to treat properties as constant?
